 * MEMOIZATION
 * ###########
 * To optimize the recursive solution use memoization. A dynamic programming 
 * technique to store intermediate calculation results.
 * 
 * Every intermediate result fib(1), fib(2), fib(3), etc. can be stored in an
 * array. When unwinding the recursion tree, duplicate calculations can be 
 * avoided by pulling results from the array. 
 *  
 * Note that the memo array needs to initialized before you make the first
 * function call.

           result = 1;

/**
 * TIME COMPLEXITY
 * This approach improves time complexity of the function to O(n) because the
 * part of the function that actually calculates a result is executed a maximum
 * of n times. That block contain two fn calls -> 2n. Add the fn initial call.
 * 
 * T(n) = 2n + 1
 * 
 * With each operation in the fn call taking O(1) time the final time 
 * complexity calculation is: T(n) = (2n + 1) * O(1) = O(2n + 1) = O(n).
